    <h1>Ayodhya Ram Mandir</h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Ram_Janmbhoomi_Mandir%2C_Ayodhya_Dham.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Ayodhya was historically known as Saketa. The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinatha and Anantanatha, and associate it with the legendary Bharata Chakravarti. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.

    The legendary city of Ayodhya, popularly identified as the present-day Ayodhya, is identified in the epic Ramayana and its many versions as the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and is hence regarded as the first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus.[8] [10] The Ayodhya dispute was centered on the Babri mosque, built 1528–29 under the Mughal emperor Babur and said to have replaced a temple that stood at the birth spot of Rama.[11] In 1992 a Hindu mob demolished the mosque, provoking riots throughout the country.[12] In 2019 the Supreme Court of India ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records, and ordered it to be handed over to a trust to build a Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative 2.0 hectares (5 acres) of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build another mosque in Dhannipur. The construction of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020 and the temple was consecrated with the deity of Balak Ram on 22 January 2024</p>

    <h1>Nagaur Fort</h1>
 <img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nagaur-Fort.jpg" alt="">
   <p>Ahhichatragarh Fort literally translates into ‘fort of the hooded cobra’ is situated in Nagaur. Spread over 36 acres, the fort was in a state of neglect till the 1980s. In 1985 the fort was placed in the care of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust. The fort has gradually been restored to its former glory with the support of four grants from the Getty Foundation, two from the UK-based Helen Hamlyn Trust and contributions from the Mehrangarh Museum Trust. The Palaces and historic spaces display period furniture, objects and an amazing group of wall paintings.

    In 2002 the Fort of Nagaur won the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Culture Heritage Conservation. It was also shortlisted for the prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2011-2013. The Nagaur Fort hosts the World Sacred Spirit Festival every year.</p>
    <h1>Jaipur HawaMahal</h1>

    <p>he Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.[5]</p>
   <h1>Mehrangarh Fort Jodhpur</h1>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Jodhpur_mehrangarh_fort.jpg/1280px-Jodhpur_mehrangarh_fort.jpg" alt="">
   <p>Mehrangarh is a historic fort located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. It stands on a hilltop, rising about 122 meters above the surrounding plains.[1] The complex spans 1,200 acres (486 hectares). It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of Rathore clan Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century.[2] The fort has seven gates, which includes main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (lit. 'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.[3]

    Within its boundaries, you'll find several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, a Chamunda Mataji Temple, as well as a museum that houses various relics. A winding road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of Kirat Singh Sodha, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.</p>

    <p>जूनागढ़ किला भारत के राजस्थान के बीकानेर शहर में एक किला है । राजा धज , रोर कुमार , ने पांचवीं शताब्दी ईसा पूर्व में जूनागढ़ रियासत पर शासन किया था। [1] किले को मूल रूप से चिंतामणि कहा जाता था और 20वीं सदी की शुरुआत में इसका नाम बदलकर जूनागढ़ या "पुराना किला" कर दिया गया जब शासक परिवार किले की सीमा के बाहर लालगढ़ पैलेस में चला गया। यह राजस्थान के कुछ प्रमुख किलों में से एक है जो किसी पहाड़ी की चोटी पर नहीं बना है। आधुनिक बीकानेर शहर किले के आसपास विकसित हुआ है। [2] [3] [4]

        किला परिसर का निर्माण बीकानेर के छठे शासक राजा राय सिंह के प्रधान मंत्री करण चंद की देखरेख में किया गया था, जिन्होंने 1571 से 1611 ईस्वी तक शासन किया था। दीवारों और संबंधित खाई का निर्माण 1589 में शुरू हुआ और 1594 में पूरा हुआ। इसे शहर के मूल किले (राव बीकाजी द्वारा निर्मित पहला किला) के बाहर, शहर के केंद्र से लगभग 1.5 किलोमीटर (0.93 मील) दूर बनाया गया था। पुराने किले के कुछ अवशेष लक्ष्मी नारायण मंदिर के पास संरक्षित हैं। [2] [5] [6]
        
        ऐतिहासिक अभिलेखों से पता चलता है कि किले पर कब्ज़ा करने के लिए दुश्मनों द्वारा बार-बार किए गए हमलों के बावजूद, कामरान मिर्ज़ा के एक दिवसीय कब्जे को छोड़कर, इसे नहीं लिया गया था । कामरान मुग़ल सम्राट बाबर का दूसरा बेटा था जिसने 1534 में बीकानेर पर हमला किया था, जिस पर उस समय राव जैत सिंह का शासन था। [7]
        
        5.28 हेक्टेयर बड़ा किला परिसर महलों, मंदिरों और मंडपों से सुसज्जित है। [3] ये इमारतें एक समग्र संस्कृति को दर्शाती हैं, जो स्थापत्य शैलियों के मिश्रण में प्रकट होती हैं। [8]</p>
     <h1>Jal Mahal Jaipur</h1>
     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Jaipur_03-2016_39_Jal_Mahal_-_Water_Palace.jpg/1280px-Jaipur_03-2016_39_Jal_Mahal_-_Water_Palace.jpg" alt="">
     <p>The Jal Mahal Palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a grand scale. The building has a picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the surrounding Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built with local sandstone, is a three-storied building, with the third floor only existing on the eastern side of the palace. The eastern side is not visible from the road side public promenade, which is the Western side of the palace. The additional lower levels of the eastern side remain underwater when the lake is full. The Jal Mahal has a terrace floor with a garden, and the garden has four Tibaris facing north, south, east and west. The Tibaris are designed in the Bengal roof style architecture while the four octagonal Chhatri on the roof mark the corners of the monument. The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage (plaster work and wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of water logging, which have been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.[1]

        The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin layer of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the project area have also been used for constructing buildings. From the northeast, the Kanak Vrindavan valley, where a temple complex sits, the hills slope gently towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up of a thick mantle of soil, blown sand, and alluvium. Forest denudation, particularly in the hilly areas, has caused soil erosion, compounded by wind and water action. As a result, silt built up in the lake incrementally raises the lake bed.[2] On the terrace of the palace, a garden was built with arched passages. At each corner of this palace semi-octagonal towers were built with an elegant cupola</p>
        <h1>Chhitor Fort</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Chittorgarh_fort.JPG/1280px-Chittorgarh_fort.JPG" alt="">
        <p>The Chittorgarh (literally Chittor Fort), also known as Chittod Fort, is one of the largest living forts in India. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort was the capital of Mewar and is located in the present-day city of Chittorgarh. It sprawls over a hill 180 m (590.6 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (691.9 acres) above the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. The fort covers 65 historic structures, which include four palaces, 19 large temples, 20 large water bodies, 4 memorials and a few victory towers.

            In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Chittorgarh Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a group called the Hill Forts of Rajasthan</p>
            <h1>Tajmahal Agra</h1>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Taj_Mahal_%28Edited%29.jpeg/1280px-Taj_Mahal_%28Edited%29.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time to thousands of mourners.[7][a]
                
                The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$498 million).[8] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
                
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts around 5 million visitors a year,[3]and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative</p>
<h1>Vijay Stambh</h1>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Tower_of_victory.jpg/800px-Tower_of_victory.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Vijaya Stambha is an imposing victory monument located within Chittor Fort in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India. The tower was constructed by the Hindu Rajput king Rana Kumbha of Mewar in 1448 CE to commemorate his victory over the army of Malwa led by Mahmud Khilji in the Battle of Sarangpur. The tower is dedicated to Hindu God Vishnu.[1][2] From the point of view of art, Colonel James Todd has considered it superior to Qutub Minar. In northern India, it comes second in length after Qutub Minar.</p>
